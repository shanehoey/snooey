# Snooey - A Remote Jekyll Theme

Snooey - A simple but extensive Jekyll theme that I use across multiple websites, including [shanehoey.com](https://shanehoey.com)

**IMPORTANT** - This theme is always under active development, to ensure that I dont break something on your website please always fork this site, and use your own fork as the remote_theme.
