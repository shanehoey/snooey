##  Usage

IMPORTANT - due to constant development and potential breaking changes I recommend that you fork this repository to use as the remote theme, rather than point at this repository.

Add the following to Gemfile

```

gem "jekyll-remote-theme"

```

Add the following to _config.yml 

```

plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme

remote_theme: shanehoey/snooey

```
