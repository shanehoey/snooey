# Snooey - A Remote Jekyll Theme

*Snooey* - A simple but extensive Jekyll theme that features:

* Ability to have different Branding and different themes. 
* Modular  

**IMPORTANT** - This theme is always under active development, to ensure that I don't break something on your website please always fork this site, and use your own fork as the remote_theme. once I reach v1.00 I will create a release that you can use instead.

View a live example @ [snooey.com](https://snooey.com) with multiple brands all running from same site!
